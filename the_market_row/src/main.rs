/*We have to create 2 or 4 functions, in a file mail, we have some posibilities like:
- Have a new person,
- Serve a person
- A customer got tired of waiting and left.
Furthermore, customers do not stay in the same position
- Clients are moving forward

Use:
- Stack
- Row
- Random

Clients will be represented by numbers, numbers will advance
If a customer leaves, or is served, 
their number is taken as past and will not be repeated in 100 rounds.
