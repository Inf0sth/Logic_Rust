## The Market

In a market row, we have some posibilities like:
- Have a new person,
- Serve a person
- A customer got tired of waiting and left.
Furthermore, customers do not stay in the same position
- Clients are moving forward

Use:
- Stack
- Queue
- Random

Clients will be represented by numbers, numbers will advance
If a customer leaves, or is served, 
their number is taken as past and will not be repeated in 100 rounds.

To test this project, donÂ´t forget exec this command in the same directory of "Cargo.toml":
`cargo build`
